Dev Notes
 -File wdn/templates_3.1/scripts/compressed/all.js: changed WDN.template_path="" -> WDN.template_path="./"
 -qtip2 dev branch downloaded for compatibility reasons with jquery-ui 1.9
 -requests to /secure results in a 302 response which cannot be handled as the redirect is done
  transparently; ajax calls result in cross domain restrictions; must ultimately have separate pages
  for secure (UNL students, staff, faculty) and non-secure (guest, visitors) users
