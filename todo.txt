FYCP
 
Deployment
  -update user info from LDAP (can't: permissions restricted to localhost)
  -commit to git (?)

LONG TERM
 -Respect the course search feature: as it is right now, a user searches
  for a course and "adds" it, but the official name is whatever the first
  listing from the bulletin app gives.  Cross listed courses may have alternative
  numbering.  Feature may be required to support crosslistings or specify the
  "preferred" numbering for this app.
 -Data source (ConnectionFactory.DataSource) is not working, 
  several alternatives were tested, but none worked.  Right now, 
  code falls back onto JDBC connection; keeping until further testing can be
  done.
 -Logging: log4j appears to be configured correctly, but is not respecting the 
  fycp.log file (all logs are going to server.log).
